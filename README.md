Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Harry Simpson. I'm currently learning at Tech Elevator, which is a coding bootcamp out of Columbus, Ohio. I am part of the National Live Remote program.

My pronouns are he/him.

After completing the bootcamp, I will be looking for a job in software or web development, and working on making games or game mods on the side. A couple of my inspirations in the gaming realm are the LWOTC mod for XCom 2: WOTC and the Vanilla Expanded mod series for RimWorld.
